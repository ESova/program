  * What is a while(true) loop?
      * it's a special command - a loop - that make things happen over and over again
      * it is a name of an Ogre we have to attack

#Note to the translator:
please when translating, tell also the english expression,
because it's a meta language for programming and it's nice they know also english expression (while(true)loop).
