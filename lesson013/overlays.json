*  __`QUESTIONS`__
  * What type of special characters are used in a while(true) loop to wrap the code in the loop that repeats forever?
      * curly braces - {}
      while(true){
        // here comes the code that repeats
      }

      * square brackets - []
      while(true)[
        // here comes the code that repeats
      ]



#Note to the translator:
please when translating, tell also the english expression,
because it's a meta language for programming and it's nice they know also english expression (curly braces, square brackets).
