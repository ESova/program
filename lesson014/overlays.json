*  __`QUESTIONS`__
  * In the written form of many languages, an indentation is an empty space at the beginning of a line
  to signal the start of a new paragraph. Many computer languages have adopted this technique
  to designate "paragraphs" or other logical blocks in the program.

  Example
  while(true) {
    // indented code here
  }

  So what is indentation?
      * empty space at the beginning of a line
      * empty space at the end of a line

#Note to the translator:
please when translating, tell also the english expression,
because it's a meta language for programming and it's nice they know also english expression (indentation).
